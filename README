* You need help with your R code? No problem: ask online!

... (but make sure you know how to ask)

*** Description

In order to have a positive experience in the active R online community and get answers to your questions, there are a number of things you absolutely have to know.

 In this workshop, we will cover:

- the various sites, their functioning, and their culture
- how to properly ask for help
- what *not* to do
- how to make a reproducible example from your data
- how to use the tidyverse package "reprex"
- how to turn a sample of your data into a format that can be shared
- how to use R datasets to illustrate your problem
- how to create a toy example from scratch
- how to anonymise your data
- how to properly format your questions

*** Target audience

This workshop is open to current SFU students, staff, and faculty of all levels and will benefit anyone feeling a little confused in the R world or unsure where to find good R resources, how to ask for help with a reproducible example, and what to do when stuck.

*** Requirements

Participants need to bring a laptop with: the latest R release[fn:1] and the latest CRAN version of the package "tidyverse"[fn:2].

[fn:1] Download R from https://cran.r-project.org/ and install it on your machine
